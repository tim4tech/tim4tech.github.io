      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Back with Cilantro After recording my initial timelapse of basil, I learned many things that would make the process much easier than the first time. Since my cilantro decided to finally pop through the soil, I decided I would use this knowledge going forward to make yet another timelapse of seedlings, but this time much easier. The first thing I did was used what I thought was a higher quality camera (Logitech c270 I believe).</description>
