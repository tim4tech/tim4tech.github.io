                <h2>Story</h2>
                <p>
                        Firstly, welcome to my cereal reviews. This is a pet project of mine where I journal about cereals I've tried and the good and bad about them. While certainly not the first cereal I've ever tried, a good start is the Sour Patch Kids Cereal. Don't judge too harshly yet, and let me explain. Often you see branded materials for games like monopoly (Fortnite Monopoly) comes to mind. I, and I imagine many others, often dismiss these knock-offs as mockeries of the originals. However, this time around, when I saw a cereal modeled after the famous sour gummy candy, I couldn't help but think "What if this cereal is actually good even though it's branded?"I thought of all the pros and cons, I compared costs to other cereals, and thought about what I was craving at the time. I even investigated other cereals that had fruity, and thus potentially sour, flavours that I might have had before. I've tried Trix and it is fruity. Maybe Sour Patch Kids Cereal is my new favorite fruit-themed cereal. So I bought it. $4.00... (approximately). How would it turn out?

                <h2>Taste</h2>
                <p>
                        Excited for my new cereal, I rushed to the dairy section to grab some milk. I must mention that the author strictly advises 2% milk for cereal consumption. While there are many reasons to prefer 2%, the balance of creaminess seems almost perfectly suited for both a drink for regular consumption and a white ocean for cereal to bathe in. Having grabbed my 2% milk, I nearly ran to the registers, weirdly enthralled to pay for this cereal that could make or break my heart. Beep. Beep. "Checkout.""Pay with Card."Beep. " Approved - Remove Card."And I was free.  

                        I break out a clean bowl. The only bowl. Somewhere around here I have another one but for now, unless we want to unpack boxes, I will accept that I have one bowl. I rip the cardboard open, pop the plastic seal, and pour the little multi-colored men out into the bowl. I pour the milk in, 2% remember,  pretending that I'm God reversing the parting of the Red Sea with all of the men drowning in a sea of milk. I have two spoons. I grabbed the closest one and scoop a spoonful of corny, sour flesh. I lift them to my mouth, ready to partake in the fruit of my labor. Did God do this? I slip them in my mouth with just the perfect amount of milk. Crunch...
                        
                        The crunch is good. There is a little chew in the middle. Right off the bat, the cold milk along with the medium-sized and long pieces of cereal was a good feel. Over time, the chew in the middle got a little more muted and became more of a mush. A shame since the crunch was pretty desirable early on. This is a cereal that could have the potential to scrape the top of your mouth due to its rough nature but I did not have this problem. A good physical design so far. 
                        
                        The real issue I have with this cereal is the flavour. I expected they might do a fruity taste with a little bit of kick like most other cereals in this genre but instead, they went for a sour punch that knocks the desire to eat this cereal right out of you. Don't get me wrong, I love sour things and I love normal Sour Patch Kids, but this sweet, sour, and creamy mix was an awful mix.

                <h2>Verdict</h2>
                <p>
                        Overall, this cereal had much more potential than it actually achieved and is just a mark on the reputation of branded goods. Not much more needs to be said. 

                        Total Score: 2/10
                        Recommendation: Better left as gelatin
