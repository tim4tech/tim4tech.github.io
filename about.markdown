My name is Timothy Ford, I go by Tim. After growing up in northern Colorado, I moved to the Black Hills of South Dakota and attended SD Mines. Along the way, I managed
to meet a co-founder in 'Bill' and applied the majority of my junior and senior year focus to the home maintenance startup HomeMetrics. This top-to-bottom, full stack experience accelerated my experience in databases, Android and iOS development, cloud API practices and deployment, and leading teams sizing from small to medium. I'm thankful to professors like Paul Hinker for supporting me and my focus towards learning in such an applied way.

A couple years interning at SRAM wrapped me into a career in the outdoor industry, and for that I could not be more thankful. I worked on the SRAM AXS App as a mobile developer for just under 5 years and learned valuable software architecture, native iOS and Android production mobile development, python scripting, and more. After finding reasons to need a remote job, I found a role at Wahoo Fitness in early 2024. My work at Wahoo Fitness centers around Bike Computers and I cannot believe my luck to work on what I would consider one of the most interesting products in the world! I also work on one of the best teams there probably is in software, shoutout to Sergio, Brad, John, Josh, Sam, and Tori. 📣🙌

Ultimate frisbee has been a huge part of my life, ever since I was 13. I think I learned of it from watching MKBHD videos, but I played once for my birthday and have been playing ever since. In 2024 I lived in downtown Minneapolis for a year (11 months actually) and played club ultimate frisbee with Lemonade. I also played with other great teams like Mustache, and helped my friend Donny coach his middle school team on Harriet Island in St Paul. I played pickup with my roommate Ben multiple times a week as well.

While I was in Minneapolis, I used the time I spent in my windowless apartment room to lock in 🔒 (lol) and attempt building something solid from an amorphous growing assistant app/automation platform I had been poking along since the spring of 2023. Originally focused on hydroponic automation, my frustration with hardware drove my focus towards a microgreen growing assistant. Today that app is launched on the iOS App store as [micgrw 🌱 - a microgreen journal](https://micgrw.app/) and gets occasional love when time and mental stamina allows.

My latest focus is spread between bikes and bike touring (with my dog Maui), building micgrw, fixing my house that's falling apart, finishing my 2004 Chevy Astro camper van build, and chasing upcoming fitness goals. 

Thanks for dropping by. 🙂🚵‍♂️🍩
